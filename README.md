# Standard Errors for Calibrated Parameters

Matlab function that computes worst-case standard errors (SE) for minimum distance estimators, given knowledge of only the marginal variances (but not correlations) of the matched moments.

The computed worst-case SE for the estimated parameters are sharp upper bounds on the true SE (which depend on the unknown moment correlation structure). For over-identified models, the package also computes the efficient moment selection that minimizes the worst-case SE. Additionally, the package can carry out tests of parameter restrictions or over-identifying restrictions.
